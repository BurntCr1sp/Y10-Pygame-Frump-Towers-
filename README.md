# Y10-Pygame-Frump-Towers-
This was a game that I created for my end of year y10 computer science class. It is a game featuring Frump and Putin. Aim of the game is to hit Putin on the head with bricks. This is a two player game with one person controlling Frump and the other Putin. "Good luck and may the odds be forever in your favor"
